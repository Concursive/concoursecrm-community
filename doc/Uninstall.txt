Uninstalling binary edition of Dark Horse CRM

- Stop Tomcat
- Delete the directory: $CATALINA_HOME/webapps/darkhorse
- Delete the directory: $CATALINA_HOME/work/Catalina/localhost/darkhorse
- Become the tomcat user and delete the directory: ~/.java/.userPrefs/org/aspcfs
- Delete the directory: /var/lib/darkhorse

At this point there shouldn't be anything from Dark Horse CRM leftover.

- Start Tomcat
- Attempt key again
