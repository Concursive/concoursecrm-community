<h2><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>Online Privacy Statement</span></h2>
<p><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>
The policy of Dark Horse is to respect the privacy of all web site visitors to the extent permitted by law. This online privacy statement is intended to inform you of the ways in which Dark Horse's web sites collect information, the uses to which that information will be put, and the ways in which we will protect any information you choose to provide us.

<p><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>
There are four types of information that Dark Horse sites may collect during your visit: network traffic logs, web visit logs, cookies, and information voluntarily provided by you.
</span></p>

<h2><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>Network Traffic Logs</span></h2>
<p><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>
In the course of ensuring network security and consistent service for all users, Dark Horse employs software programs to do such things as monitor network traffic, identify unauthorized access or access to nonpublic information, detect computer viruses and other software that might damage Dark Horse computers or the network, and monitor and tune the performance of the Dark Horse network. In the course of such monitoring, these programs may detect such information as e-mail headers, addresses from network packets, and other information. Information from these activities is used only for the purpose of maintaining the security and performance of Dark Horse's networks and computer systems. Personally identifiable information from these activities is not released to external parties without your consent unless required by law.

In the course of using Dark Horse web sites, you may choose to provide us with information to help us serve your needs. For example, you may send us electronic mail (through a mailer or a web form) to request information, you may sign up for a mailing list, or you may send us your address and other demographic information so we may send you an application or other material. Any personally identifiable information you send us will be used only for the purpose indicated. Requests for information will be directed to the appropriate staff to respond to the request, and may be recorded to help us update our site to better respond to similar requests. We will not sell, exchange or otherwise distribute your personally identifiable information without your consent, except to the extent required by law.

Dark Horse web sites may provide links to other World Wide Web sites or resources. We do not control these sites and resources, do not endorse them, and are not responsible for their availability, content, or delivery of services. In particular, external sites are not bound by Dark Horse's online privacy policy; they may have their own policies or none at all. Often you can tell you are leaving a Dark Horse web site by noting the URL of the destination site.
