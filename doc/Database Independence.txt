Summary: It is important for CFS to work with any of the supported database
servers.  Currently CFS supports PostgreSQL and Microsoft SQL Server.

Tips on being database independent:

- Don't use stored procedures

- Use queries that are SQL-92 compliant, for the most part we can get by
  with simple select queries and joins

- Use the DatabaseUtils class if a check needs to be done on the database type
  for a custom query

- Use the DatabaseUtils class when embedding the string TRUE or FALSE in
  a query 
  
  MSSQL uses bits (1's and 0's) instead of the boolean (true and false)
  
  Even better would be to use a PreparedStatement and setBoolean(int, true) or 
  setBoolean(int, false)

- Use the DatabaseUtils class to get the inserted identity of a query

- Use the PagedList object for querying pages of data...
  Ex. Use a PagedList to get rows 1-10 or 11-20
