Ticket Category Editor Business Rules:

- No two categories under the same category as their immediate parent can have the same descriptions
- Removing an active category only disables it
- Only one draft can be maintained at any given time
- Reverting to Active list will delete the draft version
- Deleting/Disabling a category will recursively delete/disable categories below it
- No categories can be added under a disabled category
