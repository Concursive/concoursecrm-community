      steps to make certain the system is usable:

        <li>Review the roles, under the Admin module, since the upgrade may have added
        additional features in which you can now provide access to users by enabling permissions</li>
        <li>Click on various modules and make sure everything appears to work</li>

      Since the JavaServerPages have not yet been compiled, you should choose to precompile the
      JSPs first so that the application works without compile delays.
      Precompiling will occur in the background and you can continue to use Dark Horse CRM.<br>
