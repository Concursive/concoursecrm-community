Sync: Hard and Soft deletes

The SyncML Delete command provides the capability for a SyncML request to delete 
data from the recipient's data store. Two forms of deletion are supported. 
Normally, when a Delete command is specified, it conveys a request to 
completely delete the specified data from the recipient's data store. The 
deleted data SHOULD no longer be associated with the originator's 
synchronization data. This is the semantics of a "Hard Delete". In addition, 
SyncML provides support for a "Soft Delete" command. The "Soft Delete" provides 
the capability to request the deletion of data from the recipient but NOT to 
remove it from the recipient's synchronization data. The rationale for a 
"Soft Delete" is based on the possibility of limited storage resources in a 
mobile device. The data is deleted to free-up storage for other, higher 
priority data. Conceptually, the deleted data remains in the set of 
synchronized data for the recipient of the "Soft Delete" command.
