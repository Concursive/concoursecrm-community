** CVS **
- Developers should place Jasper .xml files in the respository,
  the reports can be final or drafts
- The repository should have modules similar to the java hierarchy:

    CVS Repository
      /src/reports/module

- An XML installation file will be used to keep track of valid reports 
  that can be imported into CFS
- The file will be stored in:

     CVS Repository
       /pref/cfs/reports.xml
       
  The format of this file will include:
  - filename of the report, including module subfolder
  - a description of the report
  - which permission can access the report
  - ??

** Ant/Installation **

- An ant task will be used to copy reports, as defined in the XML,
  and insert them into database with the associated permission
  
  Tables/Field required:
  - [report] table
  - [report_parameter] table

** CFS Changes **

- A user interface to allow the user to select a report
- Once selected, the user can fill out parameters that the report
  uses
- The report will be added to a queue which generates reports in sequence, 
  in a thread, and associated with the user

  User Interface ideas
  
  Under each module:
    [ Reports ]
  
    / Report Queue / Submit a Report / Export Data /

- From the queue, the user can retrieve a report as a PDF
  (Pops up Acrobat in a new window)
- The user can delete a generated report from the queue
- Each night generated reports on the server will be deleted
  - maybe keep ones that haven't been downloaded
