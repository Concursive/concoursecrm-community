- Ticket Tasks can be added and assigned by a user who has edit permissions on Tickets(Status:Done)
- A Ticket Task owned by one user cannot be edited by another user unless the editing user is in the hierarchy   
  of the Task owner.(Status:Done)
- If a user does not have access to MyTasks but has access to Tickets then he can view all the Ticket tasks
  and process them depending on the permissions within Ticket Tasks.(Status:Done)
- If a user does not have acces to Tickets module he could still work on Tickets assigned to him from the
  MyTasks module with all permissions of MyTasks applying but cannot delete the task.(Status:Retricting delete pending approval)
- Ticket Tasks can be deleted only by the user who owns the Ticket.(Status:Pending approval)
- A Ticket Task can be reassigned by a user who has edit permissions on Tickets or if the user is the owner of
  the Task(Status:Pending approval).

Issues:
- Should a user who has been assigned a Ticket Task be allowed to reassign the Task
- Should a Ticket Task owner be allowed to delete a Task from the MyTasks module although he is not the owner
  of the Ticket.


Note: 
1. Taking the permissions debate to a different level it is observed that every module needs to have its own
   set of permissions and a module should not use a permission structure of a different module unless there is a compelling reason to do so, the (bussiness)rule engine when it is in place will make this concept more clear.
2. Viewing of same data at two places in the site, like tasks in TroubleTickets and MyTasks, should define the
   bussiness rules to follow and this is where we anticipate the (bussiness)rule engine comes into play.
