<briefDescription>This is the &quot;Home Page&quot;. The Top set of Tabs shows the individual modules that you can access. The second row are the functions available to you in this module.
If you are looking for a particular module or function you have seen during training or on someone else&apos;s machine, and it&apos;s NOT there it probably means that you don&apos;t have permission for that module or function.
Permissions within the system are assigned to Roles and then Users are assigned to Roles by the System Administrator.
If you are looking for a module and can&apos;t find it, it generally means you donÂ’t have permission to it.
</briefDescription>
<detailDescription>The Home Page modules has several main features.

Welcome: This is the welcome page. This displays the different modules present in the system, based on their titles and the corresponding security for the title. For a particular user all the scheduled actions for the next seven days are displayed on this page.

Mailbox: The Message System is designed to support INTERNAL business messaging needs and to prepare OUTGOING emails to addresses who are already in the system. Messaging is NOT a normal email replacement. It will not send email to address assigned &quot;on-the-fly&quot; and it will not receive OUTSIDE email

Tasks: The Task System is designed to create and assign tasks. Tasks created can be assigned to the owner/creator of the task or an employee working in the system. This page lists the tasks present along with their priorities, their due dates and age.

Action Lists: The Action List System is designed to create new Action Lists and assign contacts to the Action Lists created. For each of the contacts in a List, you can add a call, opportunity, ticket, task or send a message, which would correspondingly show up in their respective tabs. For example, adding a ticket to the contact would be reflected in the Ticket tab.

Re-assignments: A user can reassign data from one employee to another employee working under him. The data can be of different types related to accounts, contacts opportunities, activities, tickets etc, which the newly reassigned employee could view in his schedule.

Settings: This is the personal settings system page, in which you can modify/update the information about yourself and your location, and also change your password to the system. </detailDescription>

<briefDescription>This is the Pipeline System

Pipeline helps in creating opportunities or leads in the company. Each opportunity helps to follow up a lead, which might eventually turn into a client. Here you can create an opportunity, search for an existing opportunity in the system, or export the data to different formats. The dashboard reflects the progress chart in different views for all the employees working under the hierarchy of the owner/creator of the opportunity.

</briefDescription>
<detailDescription>This Pipeline System has four main features:

Dashboard: Gives you a quick, visual overview of the whole Pipeline System.

Add: This page lets you add an opportunity into the system. Here a new opportunity can be added by giving the description of the opportunity. You can add a component that is associated with the opportunity. Each component can be assigned to an employee and the type of the component can be selected. For each component the probability of closing the component, the date estimated, the best guess for closing the deal and the duration for that component can be entered.

Search: You can search for an opportunity already existing in the system based on different filters.

Export: The data can be filtered, exported and displayed in different formats.</detailDescription>

<title>Overview</title>
<description>The progress chart is displayed in different views for all the employees working under the owner or creator of the opportunity. The opportunities are shown, with their names and the probable gross revenue associated with that opportunity. Finally the list of employees reporting to a particular employee/supervisor is also shown below the progress chart</description>
<features>
<featureDescription>You can view the progress chart in different views for all the employees working under the owner or creator of the opportunity. The views can be selected from the drop down box present under the chart. The mouse over or a click on the break point on the progress chart will give the date and exact value associated with that point.</featureDescription>
<featureDescription>The opportunities created are also shown, with their names and the probable gross revenue associated with that opportunity. Clicking on the opportunities shows a details page for the opportunity.</featureDescription>
<featureDescription>The list of employees reporting to a particular employee/supervisor is also shown below the progress chart. Clicking on an employee shows the Opportunity page from that person&apos;s point of view. You can then work your way back up the chain by clicking the Up One Level link.</featureDescription>

<notes>
<noteDescription>BUG: Closed opportunities not dropped from dashboard view ... though are dropped in &quot;View Opportunities&quot;</noteDescription>
<noteDescription>LOGIC: Pipeline / Dashboard: When looking at Bill Roberts Dashboard, who reports to me, on his opportunity it shows (3) components to an opportunity when only 1 was assigned to him -- other 2 were somebody elses. Shouldn&apos;t it only show 1</noteDescription>
<noteDescription>Graphing: The system will accept a negative commission rate (e.g. -10%) and will graph it correctly. Should we allow this? Not sure why not.</noteDescription>
<noteDescription>CALC ALGORITHM BUG: Calculated graphs wrong. If date closed is 1&apos;st of month, it does it correctly across term. If start is mid-month, some dollars are dropped. Appears because it demonstrates it by &quot;area under the curve&quot; approach</noteDescription>
<noteDescription>When using &quot;Up One Level&quot; in Pipeline/Dashboard to navigate back to &quot;Self&quot; the &quot;Up One Level&quot; remains as a option even there are no superior levels.</noteDescription>
<noteDescription>BUG: Clicking on the &apos;add&apos; option produces a page with the following message. &quot;The included page caused a problem.&quot;</noteDescription>

<title>Add a Opportunity</title>
<description>This page lets you add a opportunity into the system.

Here a new opportunity can be added by giving a description of the opportunity, then adding a component that is associated with the opportunity. An opportunity can have one or more components. Each component can be assigned to a different employee and the type of the component can be selected. For each component the probability of closing the component, the date estimated, the best guess for closing the deal and the duration for that component are required. 
</description>
<features>
<featureDescription>The probability of Close, Estimated Close Date, Best Guess Estimate (what will the gross revenue be for this component?), and Estimated Term (over what time period?), are mandatory fields.</featureDescription>

<noteDescription>USABILITY: Search on &quot;Description&quot; returns a results page that shows the components -- and thus the term searched on might not be anywhere in the component description. Should return what field is searched on</noteDescription>
<noteDescription>PERFORMANCE: Account selection should be a pop up selection</noteDescription>
<noteDescription>NOMENCLATURE: The &quot;Description&quot; should be renamed &quot;Opportunity Description&quot;. And &quot;Organization&quot; should be &quot;Account&quot;</noteDescription>
<noteDescription>BUG: After doing a search, and assume nothing is found, it reflects these results in &quot;View Opportunities&quot; -- and nothing is shown because the criteria weren&apos;t met. But, these parameters are now somehow remembered and nothing will show up in &quot;View Opportunities&quot; if you click on that.</noteDescription>
<noteDescription>BUG: Search Pipeline based on &quot;Contact&quot; doesn&apos;t seem to work. Put in a contact and it brings back everything. Also, does it default to looking at &quot;My&quot; opp&apos;s or &quot;All&quot; opp&apos;s? I think it should default to look at your hierarchy. Thus, &quot;all&quot;.

<noteDescription>LOGIC: The report generates &quot;components&quot;, not &quot;opportunities&quot;, even though the type is called &quot;Opportunities Listings&quot;.

<briefDescription>Communications is a &quot;Campaign Manager&quot; Module where you can manage complex email. fax, or mail communications with your customers. Communications allows you to create and choose Groups, Messages, and Schedules to define communications scenarios from the simple to the very complex. Groups can range from a single contact chosen from a pick list to the result of a complex query of the Account/Contact database. Messages can be anything from a single-line email to a rich, multimedia product catalog to an interactive survey.</briefDescription>
<detailDescription>This Communication System has six main features

Dashboard: Track and analyze campaigns that have been activated and executed.
Messages can be sent out by any combination of email, fax, or mail merge. The Dashboard shows an overview of sent messages and allows you to drill down and view recipients and any survey results.

Add: This page lets you add a new campaign.

Campaign List: This page lets you add a new campaign into the system.

Groups: Each campaign needs at least one group to send a message to. Use criteria to filter the contacts you need to reach and use them over and over again. As new contacts meet the criteria, they will be included in future campaigns. This page lists the group names. It shows the groups created by you or everybody i.e. all the groups. 

Messages: Compose a message to reach your audience. Each campaign requires a message that will be sent to selected groups. Write the message once, then use it in any number of future campaigns. Modified messages will only affect future campaigns. Displays the list of messages, with the description and other details.

Attachments: Customize and configure your Campaigns with attachments. Attachments can include interactive items, like surveys, or provide additional materials like files. </detailDescription>

<briefDescription>This is the Tickets System

You are looking at the Ticket System home page.

You can add new tickets, search for existing tickets based on different filters and export ticket data in different formats

</briefDescription>
<detailDescription>This Tickets System has four main features

View: Lists all the tickets assigned to you and the tickets assigned in your department. Details such as the ticket number, priority, age, i.e. how old the ticket is, the company and the tickets assignment are displayed.

Add: You can add a new ticket here.

Search: Form used for searching the tickets that already exist in the system based on different filters and parameters.

Export: This page shows exported data. The data can be exported to different formats. The exported data can be viewed with its subject, the size of the exported data file, when it was created and by whom. It also shows the number of times that particular exported file was downloaded. The exported data, created by you or all the employees can be viewed in two different views. A new data file can also be exported. </detailDescription>

<noteDescription>It is possible to have permission to view the ticket module, but not have permission to view tickets, which generates an error. UPDATE: It is a permissionError which is raised and one resolution could be to define minimal permissions you need to have turned on to have view access to a module and also to exclude add/edit/delete permissions when you do not have view permissions. This is a system wide issue.</noteDescription>
<noteDescription>It looks like a ticket entered by me and assigned to me will only be shown on the entered by me section, and not the assigned to me section. I now see that this is only sometimes true.UPDATE: Any ticket created by you and assigned to yourself is showing up in both the Tickets Assigned to Me and Tickets Created By Me, not sure what the real issue is here</noteDescription>
<noteDescription>BUG:The number of assigned/unassigned tickets shown in the &apos;View Tickets&apos; and counts shown in the &apos;My Items&apos; dont correlate.</noteDescription>

<noteDescription>FEATURE: If the user does not have permission to &apos;Re-assign&apos;, the update button in Re-assign is hidden.

<noteDescription>FEATURE: When the communication manager is selected from the menu, a list of possible options (5.....example dashboard, build groups..etc are shown to the user).

<noteDescription>BUG:When permission for Access/view in &apos;Account Management&apos;/&apos;Accounts Records&apos; has been revoked, pressing on the Account Management tab, shows an error page with the permission denied method.
