Translations in Concourse Suite Community Edition are made from several supporting files.  This
archive includes everything that is needed.  Once the files are ready to be
submitted, they can be posted to the www.concursive.com web site.

To learn more about translating, visit the Concourse Suite Community Edition Language Gateway:
http://www.concursive.com/Translation.do

| FILE STRUCTURE                                                           |

Each language is associated with a specific Java Locale.  For example,
files ending in en_US are for US English.

In this archive you will find the following directories:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Care must be taken when working with these application files directly.  The
Concourse Suite Community Edition application will be reading them and expecting certain mandatory
programming code to be intact.

When editing these files, color-syntax is useful, so you might use an
editor like JEdit from http://www.jedit.org


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Directory: data                                                          |
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

File: lookuplists_*.xml

Contains a translatable file that is used during the installation of a new
Concourse Suite Community Edition database.  These items are commonly viewed in a drop-down list
to the user.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Directory: dictionary                                                    |
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

File: dictionary_*.xml

The phrase dictionary contains the majority of text that is displayed in
Concourse Suite Community Edition.  This file can be edited online using the Concourse Suite Community Edition
Language gateway.  This allows one or more developers to work on the
translation at the same time, and to just work on the changes since the
last update.

New translations may find it useful to work offline initially and then
send the document to Concourse Suite Community Edition for processing.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Directory: javascript                                                    |
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

File: dictionary_*.js

Javascript messages are used throughout the web application.  These messages
typically appear to the user in an alert box.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Directory: permissions                                                   |
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

File: permissions_*.xml

The application uses this file to understand the available modules,
the permissions associated with the module, and any related module
capabilities.

- Translate the "description" value
- Translate the "title" value

DO NOT translate the name, class, and other fields because the application uses
them across all languages.

        description="Activity Type"/>
<permission name="pipeline" attributes="v---"
            description="Access to Pipeline module" viewpoints="true"/>
<permission name="pipeline-quotes" attributes="vaed" description="Quotes"/>
<report file="opportunity_pipeline.xml" type="user"
        permission="pipeline-opportunities"
        title="Opportunities by Stage"
        description="What are my upcoming opportunities by stage?"/>

CRM.  Many of these events have names and parameters for translation.
