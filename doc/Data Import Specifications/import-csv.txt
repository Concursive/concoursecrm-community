** General Information
- Output or modify your data according to the attached Import Specifications

- On Line 1, the column names are required
- Columns do not have to be in order, and not all columns have to be used,
  as long as the column names appear in line 1 according to the specification

- For the remaining lines, there can only be one (1) record per line

- Each line consists of fields that are delimited
- If exporting from Excel, choose to save as CSV
- If generating the output from another application, use a pipe (|) character,
  TAB character, or use comma-separated-values to distinguish each field

- Return characters cannot be used in a field and must be substituted with
  either \r\n, or simply \r or \n
  However, the only field that can have the substituted return characters is the
  note field. This is a good field to put data for which there is no other field
  to map to
  
- Each field should have at most one (1) item, but can be left blank

** Field Specific Information
- For Phone Numbers, we provide several fields that can be used in place of 
  using return characters.  For example, Business Phone and Business2 Phone.  
  There must be at most one (1) phone number entered per phone number field
- If the phone number is international, it should be preceeded by a +, 
  that way any formatting used in the phone number will be preserved
- Phone number extensions can be included in the phone number and will be
  parsed, for example, you might have "800-555-1212 x234" or "800-555-1212 ext234"
  
- Some export programs have problems with zip codes, for example,
  the program might output 2142 when it should show up as 02142.
  In this case, a 0 will automatically be added for US zip codes.
  
- For Addresses, we have provided two fields for the street, Line 1 and Line 2,
  please make certain that addresses with multiple lines are mapped accordingly
  to the address fields
