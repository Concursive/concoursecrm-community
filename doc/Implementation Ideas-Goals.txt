This document is a growing list of ideas that we have considered or would
like to consider for implementation within CFS:
 
JSPs: 
- Minimize the number of add/modify/details screens within a single module and 
  across shared modules
  
Database Persistence:
- Explore JDO implementations
- Minimize the amount of SQL required to develop a base object

Classes/Objects:
- Need to have database synchronization interfaces that base objects can 
  implement
- Lighter weight base objects
- More functional "List" objects, possibly with INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE 
  capabilities
- Use more action classes per module, instead of overwhelming a single action
  class
- Reusable HTML and field validation classes

Dynamic Forms:
- Dynamic Forms are almost ready to be used in other modules, but someone
  needs to follow through on the implementation

Database Upgrades:
- Implement a streamlined process for applying table changes
