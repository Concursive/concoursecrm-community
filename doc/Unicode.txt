** DATABASES **

In order to support a universal character set, databases in PostgreSQL
should be created with the following command:
$ createdb -E UNICODE [dbname]

MS SQL Server 2000 defaults to unicode.


** REQUEST/RESPONSE **

The following has not been implemented, but is included as future reference.

Servlets can set the request encoding as follows before retrieving parameters:

  request.setCharacterEncoding("UTF-8");
  String test = request.getParameter("anything");

The encoding for the response can be handled in a couple of ways:

1) Specify the content type for the JSP output:

    <%@ page contentType="text/html; charset=utf-8" %>

You can also do this by setting the content type header manually, using
response.setContentType().

2) Specify the content type to the browser:

    <meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
