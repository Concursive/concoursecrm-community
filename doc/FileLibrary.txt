* Structure:

The ASPCFS application has a single file library in which files can be
stored and retrieved from.  This folder is typically called fileLibrary.

[base_path]: fileLibrary/$database_name/$module_folder_name
[year_path]: fileLibrary/$database_name/$module_folder_name/$year/$month$day

Depending on the module, the directory structure can further include
an id relating to items in the module, then sub-directories by date.
This is to alleviate file limits on the underlying file system.

[item_path]: $base_path/id$id/$year/$month$day
